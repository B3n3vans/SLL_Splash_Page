## 02. Logo

### Primary Logo
The primary logo is the main representation of the brand and should be used in most situations. It reflects the brand's full identity and should appear in prominent placements such as:
- Websites
- Presentations
- Marketing materials

### Secondary Logo
The secondary logo maintains the same design as the primary logo but is presented in an alternate color variation. Use when the primary color does not suit the background or specific visual context.

### Tertiary Logo
The tertiary logo is another color variation of the primary logo, designed to provide additional flexibility across different backgrounds and applications while maintaining brand consistency.

### Logo Mark Variations
Three logo mark variations available:
- **Primary** - Main brand color
- **Secondary** - Alternate color variation
- **Tertiary** - Additional color option

Each shown in a different color to ensure versatility and consistency across various backgrounds and use cases.

### Clear Space Requirements
**The logo clear space is defined as 1/4 of the logo's total height.**

This area must remain free of any text, graphics, or other visual elements to ensure the logo maintains its visual impact and legibility across all applications.
